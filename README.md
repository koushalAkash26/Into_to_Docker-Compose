# Intro to Docker Compose

This repository demonstrates how to containerize a Node.js application with a PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose. It showcases best practices for multi-stage Docker builds and managing different environments using multiple Compose files.

## Overview

This project includes two main containers:
1. **Node.js Application Container**: A containerized Node.js app.
2. **PostgreSQL Database Container**: A PostgreSQL database instance.

The repository demonstrates how to:
- Containerize the Node.js application using a multi-stage Docker build.
- Connect the application and database containers using Docker Compose.
- Manage multiple environments (e.g., development, production) with separate Compose files.

## Features
- **Multi-Stage Docker Build**: Efficiently builds the Node.js app while minimizing the final image size.
- **Docker Compose**: Easily manage and connect both containers in a single file.
- **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Separate Docker Compose files for managing different environments (e.g., development, production).

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)


## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/koushalAkash26/Intro_to_Docker-Compose.git
    cd Intro_to_Docker-Compose
    ```

2. Build and run the containers using Docker Compose.

## Usage

### Development Environment

To explore the project in a development environment, you can use the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file.

Run the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

This will spin up both the Node.js application container and the PostgreSQL database container.

### Production Environment

For a production setup, 
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
```

## Multi-Stage Docker Build

The Node.js app is containerized using a multi-stage Docker build, which allows the creation of smaller and more secure images by building and packaging only what's necessary for production.

You can find the details in the `Dockerfile` of this repository, where the build process is optimized by separating the build and runtime stages.

## Multiple Compose Files

Maintaining different environments (development, production, etc.) is a common practice in real-world applications. This repository demonstrates how to use multiple Docker Compose files to handle different configurations across environments.

You can explore how the containers are managed in the `docker-compose.dev.yml` file. Similarly, you can extend it by creating other Compose files for different environments.
